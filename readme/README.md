  ## Desciption

  It is difficult to create README files when developing

  I wanted to help developers by automating creation of README files for them

  This way, projects would always have a README file

  By leveraging on Node JS learned in Module 9, we are able to create README file

  ## Installation

  To install the project, you need to clone the GitHub repo and run the npm i inquirer command to download the inquirer package. This will allow you to run the JS in command using node index.js

  ## Usage

  After running node index.js, you will be requested to answer multiple questions which will be the content of the README file. Once all questions are answered, a README file will be created in the readme folder.

  ## Contributing
